# Quoty

Quoty is a browser extension that displays an inspiring or thought-provoking quote each time you visit ChatGPT.

With animated character-by-character text rendering, Quoty brings quotes to life right on your browser, while integrating seamlessly with the original ChatGPT experience.

## Features üöÄ

- **Dynamic Quotes:** Fetches random quotes from [QuoteSlate API](https://quoteslate.vercel.app) to provide fresh content on each page load.
- **Animated Text:** Displays each quote character-by-character, creating a smooth, engaging animation.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works with ChatGPT's modern, single-page app design, refreshing quotes without reloading the page.
- **Minimalist Design:** Fits right into the ChatGPT interface, adding a touch of inspiration without cluttering the screen.

## How It Works üß†

1. **Fetch a Quote:** Quoty sends a request to the QuoteSlate API to get a new quote each time the page loads.
2. **Animate Text Display:** Using `animateText`, Quoty displays the fetched quote character-by-character, creating a smooth animation.
3. **Refresh on URL Change:** A MutationObserver checks for URL changes to display a new quote without refreshing the page, making it ideal for modern, single-page apps.
